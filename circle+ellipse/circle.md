Circle and Ellipse
==================





Donut/torus annular region etc
------------------------------

Figuring out best ways to do this, preferably retain ability to apply stroke to both edges.

* fat stroke - easy, not very flexible
* clip - don't think will work
* mask - not sure yet whether can apply stroke to mask edges? Also shadow?
* path arcs - definitely works, a bit fiddly
