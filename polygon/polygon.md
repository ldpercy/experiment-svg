Relative coordinates
--------------------

I think I'll need this sometimes, so going to try a version that uses all(mostly) lower case (relative) path directives.
Might be a bit tricker.


Angles/lengths
--------------

It would be handy if there was an easy way of figuring out things like angles and lengths...
