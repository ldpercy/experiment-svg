Clip and mask
=============


Clip
----

Pretty much just a shape to cut another shape with.


Mask
----

Appears to just be a translucent version of clip, but not sure I fully get it yet.



Knock-out
---------

In both cases would like to be able invert the effect to be able to 'knock-out' (not sure if correct term) sections of a drawing according the shape.

There might be a flag or setting for this.
